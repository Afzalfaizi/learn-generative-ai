# International Certifications 

The Cloud Applied Generative AI Certification program not only trains you to be able to develop GenAI cloud solutions but also gets you ready to be able to pass international certifications to showcase and validate your skills. 

We encourage you to pass the following international certifications.

For those who currently do not have the required financial means, some of the exams might seem expensive, therefore it is recommended that you appear in these exams after you have started working professionally. **But it is critical that you should complete your studies right now.**
